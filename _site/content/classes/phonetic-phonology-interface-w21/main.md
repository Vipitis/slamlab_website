## Course Description

This advanced seminar will explore the relationship between two closely-linked linguistic fields of phonetics (the study of language sounds) and phonology (the study of sound patterns). In what ways do the methods and findings of phonetics and phonology overlap, contradict, or inform what another?

Students will learn to engage with the material as researchers. We will practice how to read primary research articles, discuss ideas orally and in writing, and conduct original research. Students are encouraged to explore their own interests, and parts of the syllabus will change depending on the interests of the group. The final research paper is an opportunity for each student to more deeply explore a topic of their interest in, or relating to, phonetics-phonology. The development of the paper topic will take place in dialogue with the readings and each other, with structured guidance and feedback.
