## Language in the United States
[**Dr. Christopher Geissler**](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/chris/) <span class="middot-divider"></span> **Summer 2022**

Students will develop an understanding of the history and current status of the languages of the United States. They will use linguistic data and structure to inform study of language variation, history, contact, endangerment, and revitalization.

## Programming for Linguists
[**Dr. Kevin Tang**](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/kevin/) <span class="middot-divider"></span> **Summer 2022**

This class is an introduction to computer programming in the high level programming language Python. To make the course relevant to linguists, you will learn how Python can be used to solve some fun linguistic problems such as ‘What’s the most used word by William Shakespeare? Who has a bigger vocabulary: Jay-Z or Helene Fischer? and some fundamental linguistic tasks: part-of-speech tagging, syllabification, discovery of morphemes and phrases, and cryptography/author identification. We will learn to conduct some basic language processing, such as compiling frequency lists for segments/syllables/words and regular expressions. The class is suitable for students with little to no prior experience in computing or programming.

## Towards a career in language technology: linguistic annotation
[**Akhilesh Kakolu Ramarao**](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/akhilesh/) <span class="middot-divider"></span> **Summer 2022**

You do not have to be a computer wizard to break into the language technology industry. Computational models of human language (Natural Language Processing) are only as good as the annotations of different linguistic structures. Given the richness of human language, high quality and complex annotations can only be performed by humans equipped with formal linguistic training, native speaker's intuition, and knowledge of the world. Linguistic data annotation is thus extremely important, making it a sought-after skill in the language technology industry. 'Data annotator' is an entry-level position at technology companies which requires linguistics training but not programming experience. Annotators work in an interdisciplinary environment with engineers, managers, linguists and so on, and can find opportunities for furthering their careers in the technology industry. This course offers a taste of annotation work for those curious about the field, and provides practical training and experience for applying for such a position. In this course, students would gain a basic understanding of the annotation process, learn about the creation of different annotation schemes, work with annotation softwares commonly used in the industry and evaluation of annotations. Along the way, students will gain familiarity with common text-processing tools and data formats.
