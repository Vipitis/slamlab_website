We are creating a new set of web-based interactive learning units in phonetics and phonology. These serve two purposes: supplementing student learning in the English Linguistics Basismodul, and providing review material for intermediate/advanced-level courses. With the proposed units, instructors have a resource for flipped classroom teaching or self-paced learning by assigning them to students to complete outside of limited contact hours. Students are able to review their most needed topics, and spend as much time as necessary. With less class-time spent on review, courses can more efficiently focus on new material. Each unit has a short quiz with autograded questions and feedback that provides dynamic links to relevant sections of the unit.
