summary = 'This course provides you with an elementary introduction to English phonetics and phonology, designed for those who have no previous knowledge whatsoever of the subject. It begins with a very elementary introduction to articulatory phonetics, and then proceeds to introduce the student to a very simplified account of some of the main aspects of the phonological structure of present-day English. Languages other than English will also be examined to compare and contrast the linguistic structural differences and gain insights on linguistic generalisation.'
