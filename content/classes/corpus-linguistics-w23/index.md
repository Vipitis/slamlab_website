summary = 'Recent advances in both computing power and statistical thinking have allowed the use of huge amounts of data in a way not feasible in earlier times. In this course, we will learn how to use these new methods and data sources to investigate the structure of language. Of course, language is a multimodal phenomenon, i.e., it exists not just in the form of written text, but also in spoken form, and these different modes require different approaches. We will learn about the different methods needed to approach these different modalities of language.'
