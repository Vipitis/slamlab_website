We will focus on core areas of English linguistics.In this first part of the Introduction to English language and linguistics we will deal with the structure of language (in particular of the English language) and acquire the terminology and methodology of modern linguistics. The focus will be on the core areas of linguistics: the study of sound structure (phonology), word structure (morphology), and sentence structure (syntax).In the second part of the Introduction to English language and linguistics, the formal levels of linguistic analysis (phonology, morphology, syntax) will be viewed in relation to their meaning(s) as well as to their contexts of use. Topics therefore include semantics, pragmatics, and sociolinguistics.'
