## Introduction to Corpus Phonetics
[**Dr. Kevin Tang**](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/kevin/) <span class="middot-divider"></span> **Winter 2021**

This course aims to fill a gap between the studentsâ€™ knowledge in phonetics and phonology and their ability to applying that knowledge to ask non-trival research questions using a large amount of speech and lexical data. It would cover corpus compilation, semi-automatic annotation (phonetic transcription and forced-alignment), extraction of phonetic and phonological variables and the basics of statistical analyses of corpus data. It complements other courses such as advanced phonetics, quantitative and experimental methods, and corpus/computational linguistics. The course will involve the use of programming languages (such as Python, R and unix commands) and they will be introduced as needed.

## Phonetics and Phonology Similarity
[**Dr. Kevin Tang**](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/kevin/) <span class="middot-divider"></span> **Winter 2021**

This course will focus on the role of similarity in phonetics and phonology. Everybody uses puns (A. Zwicky & E. Zwicky 1986) and rhymes (Kawahara 2007), and experiences speech errors (Fromkin 1980) and speech misperception (Tang 2015). However, have you asked yourselves -- what makes a good pun and a good rhyme? How come "Merry Christmas" is [mele kalikimaka] in Hawaiian? Who is Lady Mondegreen in the fourth line of the Scottish ballad "The Bonny Earl of Murray"? In this course, we will look into these naturally-occuring linguistic phenomena with a focus in phonetic and phonological similarity. We will see these powerful linguistic external evidence has played an important role in theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics. We will examine primary literature that use linguistic external evidence and we will learn how they can be quantitatively collected and analysed. There will not be a single textbook as such, but rather we'd sample from existing research studies on these topics.

## The Phonetic-Phonology Interface
[**Dr. Christopher Geissler**](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/chris/) <span class="middot-divider"></span> **Winter 2021**

This advanced seminar will explore the relationship between two closely-linked linguistic fields of phonetics (the study of language sounds) and phonology (the study of sound patterns). In what ways do the methods and findings of phonetics and phonology overlap, contradict, or inform what another? Students will learn to engage with the material as researchers. We will practice how to read primary research articles, discuss ideas orally and in writing, and conduct original research. Students are encouraged to explore their own interests, and parts of the syllabus will change depending on the interests of the group. The final research paper is an opportunity for each student to more deeply explore a topic of their interest in, or relating to, phonetics-phonology. The development of the paper topic will take place in dialogue with the readings and each other, with structured guidance and feedback.
