* [Chris Geissler](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/chris/) **published in *Language***. The paper appears in the December 2021 issue of *Language*. The article, ""Gender Bias and Stereotypes in Linguistics Example Sentences," written in collaboration with Hadas Kotek, Rikker Dockum, and Sarah Babinski, examines the distribution of gender in the example sentences published in three major linguistics journals over the past twenty years. The results show that example sentences include twice as many male-gendered characters as female-gendered ones, with female-gendered characters are further underrepresented as grammatical subjects, agents, and experiencers.
Check out the full results as well as recommendations for linguistics researchers and teachers here, and browse the rest of the issue here.
