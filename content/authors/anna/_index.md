Anna is a linguistics student working on the informativity grant project as the person responsible for language modeling with Naive Discriminative Learning and supplementary computational implementations.

She is currently writing her BA thesis with [Dr. Kevin Tang](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/kevin/) and [Dr. Chris Geissler](htps://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/chris/) on effects of probabilistic reduction as modelled by NDL. The thesis is a pilot study of the informativity project.

 She also has various other tasks in the lab, from maintaining and improving the website with [Akhilesh](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/akhilesh/), to writing tutorials and documenting code. 

Outside of academia, Anna is a movie and music enthusiast and enjoys all kinds of sports and videogames in her free time.
