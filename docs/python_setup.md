# Python (WSL2) 

First, check whether Python is installed.

``` bash
python3
```
---
If you see something like below, you already have Python installed. Type `exit()` to exit python and continue your setup journey with a different tutorial :)

```bash
Python 3.8.10 (default, date, time)
[GCC 9.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```
---

If you do not, you can install Python by entering the line below. Adding `ipython3` automatically installs the Python Kernel for Jupyter notebook.
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip ipython3
```

To confirm your installation, type python 3 again. You should now see something like mentioned above.
